TLDR, once a ElementsBamboo seedling begins growing, it doesn't sprout above ground for the first five years. During that time, it stays busy building a strong and elaborate root system to anchor itself when it finally grows to be more than 80 feet tall. When it finally does sprout, it shoots up multiple stories in a matter of weeks.",

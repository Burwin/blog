      Once a month, I get together with a small group of ambitious and brilliant
      friends in Canton to eat steak and talk about business. The conversation
      moves fast, and challenges me to keep up. I love it.

      But I often leave with a feeling of angst, like I'm not doing enough in
      business, or I'm letting opportunities slip by. They bring so many
      orthogonal perspectives on business that I feel like I'm
      <span class="italic">this close</span> to cracking the code and stumbling
      upon a eureka moment.
    </ElementsBp>

      We had one last night. Driving away, I had the same feeling. But this
      time, I had my eureka:

        Your obsession for the future is sabotaging your present, and your
        future. Focus on optimizing where you are now, and the future will bloom
        in time.
      </ElementsBp>
      <ElementsBp> Know your place. Fulfill it. </ElementsBp>
    </ElementsBquote>
    <ElementsBp>
      It's not a new concept, but... it's <span class="italic">real</span> now.
    </ElementsBp>
    <ElementsBp>
      A part of this was due to me realizing two things:
    </ElementsBp>
    <ElementsBul>
      <ElementsBli>
        I feel confident that if I just devoted enough time and energy, I could
        start making a ton of money
      </ElementsBli>
      <ElementsBli>
        But if I devoted this much time and energy to this, I seriously risk my
        children turning out poorly, creating a dead end and making any wealth
        I've gained completely pointless when I die
      </ElementsBli>
    </ElementsBul>
    <ElementsBp>
      So there's a weird dichotomy that somehow balances... In order to
      meaningfully focus on my current situation, it helps to have a
      multi-generational perspective. And when I primarily have a
      multi-generational orientation, it naturally leads to me knowing that the
      most important thing for me to do now is to focus on my current situation,
      not worrying and planning so obsessively for the future.

    <ElementsBp> Know my place. </ElementsBp>
    <ElementsBp>
      My family is on the upswing, materially and spiritually. In order to
      maintain that - sustainably - I need to approach family growth like any
      other growth endeavor. If I went too hard in the gym, I would injure
      myself and end up setting back progress instead of simply maintaining
      humble consistency. If I stayed awake working until midnight 2-3 nights in
      a row, I might get a marginal amount more accomplished, but would risk
      getting sick, brain fog, burnout, etc.
    </ElementsBp>

      I have ideas that I want to do in business, family, and community. Big
      ideas. It's possible I'm the one that gets to implement some of them, but
      it also just might not be my place. My first priority needs to be to
      establish solid foundations so future generations can continue the path -
      well-rested and without any slipped discs.
